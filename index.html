    I am a Communications Engineer with more than three years of experience in
    the defense industry. I enjoy learning new skills and I'm currently learning
    <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/"><em>The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp</em></a> from <strong><a href="https://www.udemy.com">Udemy</a></strong></a>. In my free time when I'm not working or
    learning I enjoy hiking/camping, rock climing, and parkour. I am also a <a href="https://www.padi.com/courses/open-water-diver"> PADI Open Water Certified </a> scuba diver and enjoy exploring new dive spots around the globe.

            Computers</em>, Pacific Grove, CA, 2017, pp. 205-208.</a></strong>

            Visibility is an important part of highway driving. Weather-related visibility limitations have caused several major pile-ups (crashes) over the years all over the country. These limitations are caused due to, but not limited to, fog
            and rain. It is vital to be aware of the driving environment and conditions when traveling on interstates and highways at speeds upwards of 70 mph. Crashes caused at these speeds usually result in injuries and sometimes death. In an
            effort to minimize/reduce the rate of such incidents, this project intends on automatically detecting driving visibility ranges in real time based on camera systems that already exist on the Florida Highway System. This will be done to
            alert travelers of driving hazards due to visibility limitations. We plan on doing this by performing analysis on images taken over time to detect the density of fog to determine the visibility distance. This thesis presents a
            conceptual development, theoretical design, implementation, and the implementation results to achieve automatic fog detection in day-time and night-time images on a standard scale regardless of the image intensity. (i.e. Day-time and
            Night-time images have the same scale). Images are considered independently with no reference image to compare with. A review of related work is conducted for fog detection and sharpness measure of images to achieve this goal.

            Dynamic climbing robots have shown vertical speeds that approach those of the fastest climbing animals, but to date, no work has been conducted on directional control or maneuverability while climbing for these platforms. Directional
            control in animals during high-speed terrestrial running utilizes altered leg kinematics and leg specialization, however, little work has been done to classify biological strategies for maneuverability in the scansorial regime. To gain
            insight on how alterations of leg kinematics effect maneuverability during high-speed climbing, we propose three methods for directional control and implement them on a high-speed, dynamic climbing robotic platform. These methods alter
            the leg kinematics of the platform through asymmetrically changing the foot placement, center of mass, and leg length. We show that heading angles of up to 37° off of vertical are possible while only decreasing the vertical ascension
            rate by 20%.
